# **2** TypeScript Query Cookbook

This chapter contains a cookbook of examples using the CarbonQL TypeScript client. The chapter is broken up into two sections, each with a different motivating use case:

* [Governance Queries][gov], which are motivated by the need of engineering and IT leadership to understand what is happening in their organizations, and how they are tracking against important metrics relating to, _e.g._, applied security updates, compliance, network security, and so on.
* [Operations Queries][ops], which are motivated by the need of engineers to understand what is happening inside their cluster to, _e.g._, mitigate livesite incidents, detect misconfigurations during a rollout, and so on.
